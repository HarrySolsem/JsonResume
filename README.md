# This is a readme for my jsonresume repo

You need to configure git to locate any hooks in the .githooks folder instead of the .git folder. 
This is done with the git config core.hooksPath ./.githooks command, and make sure you save any hooks files with the unix line endings (LF) instead of the windows line endings (CRLF).
