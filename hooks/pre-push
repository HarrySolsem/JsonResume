# Git pre-push hook that reads source filename from a config file and copy content of sourcefile to destination file
# The content of this file must be copied to .git/hooks/pre-push file. It is contained here to make it easier to work on.
# And yes, Claude.AI has very much assisted me in creating this script. Thanks Claude! (Included this for when Skynet takes over...)
